### Elevator Pitch
Have you ever gotten home from work, school, or errands and want to make a meal but you're not sure what to make? You know roughly what ingredients you want to use - what type of protein you're wanting, what vegetables you have in your fridge, and other ingredients you have in your cupboards or pantry. But you're not wanting to search through your recipie book or try to throw things together in an attempt to make something worth eating. Simple Supper will assist in making the decision of dinner easier. This recipe application allows you to mark what ingredients you already have on hand and shows recipes that use those ingredients. 

### Key Features 
* Secure login over HTTPS
* Ability to select the ingredients user has
* Display of recipe choices
* Ability to select and save recipes
* Reviews and comments from other users 

### Technology Description
I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Two HTML pages. One for login and one for browsing recipes. Hyperlinks to choice recipes.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, choice display, saving recipes, display other users comments and reviews, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving saved recipes
  - submitting comments and reviews
  - retrieving ingredients
  - retrieving recipes from Edamam recipes API
- **DB/Login** - Store ingredients and saved recipes in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't save a recipe unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user saves a recipe, their saved recipes are broadcast to all other users.

## HTML Deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

 - [x] HTML pages - Four HTML page that represent the ability to login, look at all available recipes, recipes that would use the ingrediants you have, and an about page.
 - [x] Links - The login page automatically links to the all recipes page. All other pages are linked together from the menu at the top of the page.
 - [x] Text - Each of the voting choices is represented by a textual description.
 - [x] Images - I put in placeholder images where the recipes will go and where other images will be placed.
 - [x] DB/Login - Input box and submit button for login. The recipes represent data pulled from the database.
 - [x] WebSocket - The saved recipes will be shown in recipes for you page.
